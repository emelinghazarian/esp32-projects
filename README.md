# ESP32 Project - IOT course in Amirkabir University of Technology (first project)

## Overview

This project provides a hands-on introduction to working with the ESP32 microcontroller. We will go through various stages of setup, programming, and debugging, covering both basic and advanced functionalities. By the end of the project, you will have a solid understanding of GPIO control, debugging through serial communication, WiFi connectivity, and communication with peripherals using I2C.

## Project Objectives

1. **Setting Up the IDE**
   - Learn to connect with the ESP32 board using Arduino IDE.
   - Install the necessary compiler and set up the environment to develop code for ESP32.

2. **Basic GPIO Control**
   - Write a program to toggle a GPIO pin (such as turning an LED on and off).
   - Use an LED with a series resistor to observe the output.

3. **Debugging via Serial Communication**
   - Learn basic debugging techniques using the serial terminal.
   - Use UART communication to log the LED status changes for better visibility of the program's behavior.

4. **WiFi Connectivity**
   - Enable WiFi functionality of the ESP32 board.
   - Write a program that connects to a local WiFi network and prints a "Hello World" message after successfully establishing a connection.

5. **I2C Communication**
   - Work with the LM75 temperature sensor using I2C protocol.
   - Write a program to connect to the LM75, read temperature data every 5 seconds, and display the results on the terminal.
